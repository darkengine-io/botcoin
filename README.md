Botcoin
=======

A Steam bot that bought and sold TF2 items for Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

These days, all the APIs are broken, and the code is not the cleanest (I was 17 at the time). Nevertheless, I like to keep it on display as it powered a successful business, and provided my teenage self with some much welcomed side cash.

Formerly live at http://steamcommunity.com/id/botcoin/
